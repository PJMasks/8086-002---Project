## Data description

The data displayed here show average spending levels during hospitals. An MSPB episode includes all Medicare Part A and Part B claims paid during the period from 3 days prior to a hospital admission through 30 days after discharge. These average Medicare payment amounts have been price-standardized to remove the effect of geographic payment differences and add-on payments for indirect medical education (IME) and disproportionate share hospitals (DSH). Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services uses the information on this web page to calculate a hospital, which is reported on Hospital Compare. The data can be downloaded from [this link](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/medicare-hospital-spending-by-claim-61b57).  

The data contain 13 Columns and 69631 rows, [see details in screen-shot](https://github.com/vnikesh/8086-002---Project/blob/master/Deliverable/Data%20Cleaning%20Documentation/Support%20Files/Data%20set%20of%20Medical%20Hospital%20speinding%20by%20claim%20before%20data%20clean.pdf).

## Data clean up procedure by Microsoft Excel 2016.
-  ##### The start date and end Date were removed because they are the same across all the rows (start date =1012015; end date = 12312015)
   - **Procedure**
       - Select the entire column under *start date* and *end date* by clicking the column heading and hit backspace and delete the entire data in those columns.
- ##### To make analysis easier, the percentage values were formatted as number(removing the % symbol) with two decimal
    - **Procedure**
        - Select the entire required column and hold **CTRL+H**
        
- ##### To make analysis easier, the cost or spending were formatted as number, where all the cost or spending was accompanied with $ as units
   - **Procedure**
        - Select the entire required column and hold **CTRL+H**
        - Using Find & Replace, find all the '$' values and replace them with empty space
- ##### The Period data was re-annotated with numbers from 1 - 4
   -  **BeforeIHA** - 1 to 3 days Prior to Index Hospital Admission 
   -  **DuringIHA** - During Index Hospital Admission 
   -  **AfterIHA** - 1 through 30 days After Discharge from Index Hospital Admission
   - **ComEpisode** - Complete Episode
- ##### The claim types were re-annotated as follows:
   - Durable Medical Equipment	- **DME**

   - Regional Hospital - **RH**
   - Community Hospital - **CMH**
     - **Procedure**
        -  In a new column write down the periods/claim types/hospital names and the respective abbreviations.
        -  Using **VLOOKUP(lookup_value, table_array, col_index_num,[range_lookup])**, replace the  periods/claim types/hospital names with their respective abbrevations.
 - Abbreviated the column names for easier viewing as follows:
   - Avg_Spending_Per_Episode_Hospital    - **ASPE_Hospital**
   - Avg_Spending_Per_Episode_State      - **ASPE_State**
   - Avg_Spending_Per_Episode_Nation     - **ASPE_Nation**

     - **Procedure**
        - Select the required column names and replace them with their abbreviations.
-  Removed the rows where the average spending is **0**, as it doesn't help us in the analysis.
-  Change the values with **percentage** to **decimal** values to help in analysis.
